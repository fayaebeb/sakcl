## **Explained Prompt**: Buy ZEKO if P/E ratio is above 15

<UseCase type="async-human" />

### Scenario

When the user requests to buy a specific company stock when its P/E ratio is above 15, the chatbot will monitor this metric and seek the user's approval (authorization) before executing any transaction.

<br />
This process is streamlined through Auth0, utilizing the CIBA (client-initiated backchannel authentication) flow to facilitate
asynchronous user approval as needed. This ensures the user consents to the operation before any purchase order is executed.

### How it works

1. **User Initiates Purchase Request**: The user instructs the chatbot to monitor a specific company's stock, indicating a desire to purchase if the P/E ratio exceeds zero.
2. **Monitoring and Notification**: Market0 continuously tracks the company's P/E ratio. When it rises above zero, the system notifies the user (using CIBA) to approve the purchase.
3. **User Confirmation**: Upon notification, the user reviews the details and confirms whether to proceed with the transaction.
4. **Purchase Completion**: Once the user approves, Market0 completes the purchase of 10 shares of the specified company.

To implement this functionality, we use several helper functions and components, detailed below.

<CodeBlock title="startAuthenticationRequest" code="https://github.com/auth0-lab/market0/blob/main/sdk/auth0/ciba.ts" example="https://github.com/auth0-lab/market0/blob/main/sdk/auth0/ciba.ts#L84-L107">
{`/**

  * 
  * @param userId - The ID of the user to authenticate.
  * @param scope - The scope of the authentication request.
  * @returns An object containing the authentication request ID and the polling interval.

  const { authReqId, interval } = await startAuthenticationRequest(
    userId,
    scope
  );
