## **Explained Prompt**: Show me forecast for ZEKO

<UseCase type="authorization-rag" />

### Scenario

When a user submits a forecast inquiry for a specific company, like Zeko, the chatbot will generate a response using relevant documents retrieved from the vector store. By default, Market0 will only include publicly available filings. However, users may also have access to analyst-level forecasts, providing them with additional insights when the response is generated.

<br />
OKTA FGA (Fine-Grained Authorization) is used to check which documents the user has access to based on their permissions.

### How it works

1. **User Forecast Request**: The user requests a forecast for a specific company, such as ZEKO.
2. **Document Retrieval**: Market0 handles the request and employs a retriever to search its vector store for documents relevant to the requested information. It applies filters to ensure only the documents the user has access to are considered.
3. **Response Generation**: Based on the retrieved documents, Market0 compiles a tailored response for the user. Depending on user's permissions the response could be based on analyst-level forecasts.

To implement this functionality, we use several helper functions and components, detailed below.

<CodeBlock title="FGARetriever (withCheckPermission)" example="https://github.com/auth0-lab/market0/blob/main/llm/actions/newsletter.ts" code="https://github.com/auth0-lab/market0/blob/main/sdk/fga/langchain/rag.ts">
{`// Get the db vector store
const vectorStore = await getDocumentsVectorStore();

// Create a retriever that filters the documents by symbol
const retriever = vectorStore.asRetriever({
    filter: { symbol },
});

// Create a Retriever Wrapper that filters the documents by user access
const fgaRetriever = new FGARetriever({
    retriever,
    fgaClient,
    buildQuery: (doc) => ({
        user: \`user:\${claims.sub}\`,
        relation: RELATION.CAN_VIEW_DOCS,
        object: \`doc:\${doc.metadata.id}\`,
    })
});

const docs = await fgaRetriever.invoke('forecast of ZEKO');
console.dir(docs);`}
