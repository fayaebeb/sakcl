/**
 * This tool allows users to buy stocks while enforcing access control through Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA).
 *
 * **Purpose:**
 * - This demo illustrates the use of FGA to determine whether a user is authorized to purchase a specific stock, demonstrating stock purchase restrictions based on user roles or attributes.
 *
 * **Authorization Logic:**
 * - FGA is used to impose restrictions, such as preventing users from buying certain stocks if they are insiders or employees of financial institutions.
 *
 * **Examples of Restrictions:**
 * - Users may be restricted from buying a stock if they are employed by a financial institution.
 * - Users who are classified as insiders for a particular stock may be prohibited from purchasing shares of that stock.
 *
 * **Workflow:**
 * 1. The user selects a stock they wish to buy.
 * 2. FGA checks the userâ€™s eligibility based on their attributes (e.g., employment, insider status).
 * 3. If authorized, the user proceeds with the purchase. If not, the purchase is blocked, and an appropriate message is returned.
